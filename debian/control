Description: CAM program & Python library for generating toolpaths
 PyCAM is a toolpath generator for 3 axis machines. The generated
 GCode can be used with EMC2 and other machine controllers.
 The included Python library can be used independently from the GUI.
 .
 Features:
    * read and write STL model files (3D)
    * support for 2D models (DXF/SVG/PS)
    * generate toolpaths (GCode) for various strategies and drill
	  definitions
    * manage and store processing templates
    * scale, move, rotate, flip and transform the model
    * interactive 3D model view based on OpenGL
    * non-interactive generation of GCode via commandline
	* render single-line fonts (provided by QCAD)
