PyCAM tutorial #2
"Multi-layered models"

2
00:00:05,050 --> 00:00:08,250
Inkscape is a useful program
for designing flat models.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
Here we combine two boxes
of different colors.

4
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:15,550
The red box marks the
edges the object.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,500
The green box is supposed
to be carved out of the stock.

6
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:24,950
Use the clipboard
for a quick test.

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,500
Open PyCAM and paste the
model from the clipboard.

8
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:33,750
Now you should check
the winding of the polygons.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,100
Outer edges are drawn
with full intensity.

10
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:41,550
The edges of holes are
drawn with only 50% opacity.

11
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:44,600
Here all polygons have
the same winding.

12
00:00:44,950 --> 00:00:47,950
Even "Revise directions" does not help
since the polygons are at different levels.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,100
We need to fix this with Inkscape.

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:54,850
Convert one of the boxes to a path.
Reverse the direction of this path.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,400
Now the winding of the inner
polygon is reversed.

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,250
Toggle the direction again,
if necessary.

17
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,900
Use the "undo" feature
if you made a mistake.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:18,450
The vertical distance between
the two polygons is currently 1mm.

19
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:24,900
We need to scale this to the
required height, e.g. 16mm.

20
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,650
It is about time to move the model
to its final location.

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,200
The stock material is 24mm thick,
thus we move the model 24mm below zero.

22
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,950
A margin of 8mm on top
of the model remains.

23
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,800
Configure the tool if necessary.

24
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:53,050
The 3mm flat end mill is OK for us.

25
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,500
Adjust the Engraving parameters.

26
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,850
Each layer should be up to 10mm thick.
The offset is half of the tool's diameter.

27
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,600
We want to pocket the inner hole.

28
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,350
Choose the 3mm tool for the
Engraving task.

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,500
Run the toolpath generator.

30
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,650
The result looks fine.

31
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,900
You can verify the toolpath
with a simulation.

32
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,150
Store the GCode in a file.

33
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:09,650
