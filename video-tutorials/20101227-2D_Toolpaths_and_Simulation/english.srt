00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,500
a PyCAM tutorial

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Load the SVG file of a 2D contour model.
In this example I will use a reprap (Lasercut) model file.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Change the tool radius of your choice.
We will use a 2mm flat end mill.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Choose an appropriate feedrate suitable for
your machine and the material.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Choose a template with the "Engraving" strategy.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,000
"Step down": the maximum height of each layer.
"Engrave Offset": usually zero or the tool radius.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Select a bounding box. Choose "Fixed margin".
Enter the height of your plate as the lower z margin.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Rotate, pan and zoom the model view
by holding down one of the mouse buttons.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
Add support bridges to prevent small pieces from
breaking away. Choose the automatic distribution.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Usually you will want to increase the height
of the support bridges.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Add some more support bridges by reducing
the average distance between neighbouring ones.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Configure one of the task templates with
the tool, the process and the bounding box.

13
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
Start the toolpath generation.

14
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,000
We will skip the delay here ...

15
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Reduce the safety height to minimize machine time.
Check the live update of the toolpath in the 3D view.

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Choose one of the corner accuracy modes.
(see the EMC2 manual for details)

17
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
Run the toolpath simulation to
check the resulting machine moves.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Increase the simulation speed (compared to real-time).

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Open the "Preferences" window again (CTRL-P).

20
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Disable all superfluous visible items.

21
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Check the details of the toolpath.

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Save the resulting toolpath as a GCode file.

23
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,000
Have fun!
