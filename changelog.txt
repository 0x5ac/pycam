Version 0.2 - UNRELEASED
 * added an alternative GTK interface with additional features:
  * configurable 3D view settings: model / toolpath / axis / drill progress / frame skip
  * manipulation of the model: rotation, flip, swap, scale, move
  * saving the model to an ascii STL file
  * load/save processing settings from/to a file
  * handling of multiple processing templates (e.g. "Rough", "Semi-finish" and "Finish")
  * configure "material allowance" for a minimum distance between drill and model
  * configure the "safety height" for the machine
  * based on GtkGlExt (for OpenGL)
  * visualize conflicting processing settings
  * configure "overlap" instead of "lines" and "samples"
  * configure "maximum step down" instead of "layers"
  * show a progress bar during calculations
 * improved performance by (optionally) using the "Open Dynamics Engine" (ODE) for
   collision detection
 * added basic lightning to the OpenGL view
