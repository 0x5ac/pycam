PyCAM is a toolpath generator for 3-axis CNC machining.
It loads 3D models in STL format or 2D contour models from DXF or SVG files.
The resulting [G-Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) can be used
with [LinuxCNC](http://www.linuxcnc.org/) or any other machine controller.

PyCAM supports a wide range of toolpath strategies for 3D models and 2D contour models.

PyCAM runs on Linux, <del>Windows</del> and <del>MacOS</del>. It is free software licensed under the
