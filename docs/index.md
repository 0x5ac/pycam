PyCAM is a toolpath generator for 3-axis CNC machining.
It loads 3D models in STL format or 2D contour models from DXF or SVG files.
The resulting [G-Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) can be used
with [LinuxCNC](http://www.linuxcnc.org/) or any other machine controller.

PyCAM supports a wide range of toolpath strategies for 3D models and 2D contour models.
Take a look at the [Features](features) page for a full list features.

PyCAM runs on Linux, <del>Windows</del> and <del>MacOS</del>. It is free software licensed under the
[GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0).

## Download

Work on PyCAM has resumed after a period of 6 years and work is being done to 
modernise the code base and make it run on recent operating systems.

New releases are available from the GitHub releases page:
<https://github.com/SebKuzminsky/pycam/releases>

The Debian package installs and runs on Debian Jessie and Stretch.  The 
source code may work on other platforms, like Windows and Mac, but is untested.
Before installing you might want to take a look at the [System requirements](requirements).

Older releases are still available on the 
[SourceForge download page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pycam/files/pycam/).
