PyInstaller (http://pyinstaller.org) can be used to create standalone binaries for Windows.

How to build a standalone exe file (on Windows only):
1) download pyinstaller
2) run "cmd"
3) "cd PATH_TO_PYCAM"
4) "python PYINSTALLER_PATH\Build.py pyinstaller\pycam.spec"
5) test and upload the binary file "pycam-VERSION_standalone.exe"

Known issues:
- the "logo_gui.png" image is not displayed in the "Preferences" window
  (the dll for png support is not included; the "pixbuf.loaders" file does not exist)
