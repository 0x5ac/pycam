PyInstaller (http://pyinstaller.org) can be used to create standalone binaries for Windows.

How to build a standalone exe file (on Windows only):
1) download pyinstaller
2) patch pyinstaller (use pyinstaller_fix_module_exception.patch)
   see http://www.pyinstaller.org/ticket/205 for details
3) run "cmd.exe"
4) "cd PATH_TO_PYCAM"
5) "python PYINSTALLER_PATH\Build.py pyinstaller\pycam.spec"
6) test and upload the binary file "pycam-VERSION_standalone.exe"

Known issues:
- the "logo_gui.png" image is not displayed in the "Preferences" window
  (the dll for png support is not included; the "pixbuf.loaders" file does not exist)
