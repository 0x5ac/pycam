PyInstaller (http://pyinstaller.org) can be used to create standalone binaries for Windows.

How to build a standalone exe file (on Windows only):
1) install UPX (compression)
 * Debian/Ubuntu: apt-get install upx-ucl
 * Windows: http://upx.sourceforge.net
2) download pyinstaller (v1.4 was used)
3) patch pyinstaller (use pyinstaller_fix_module_exception.patch)
   see http://www.pyinstaller.org/ticket/205 for details
4) run "cmd.exe" (or open a terminal)
5) "cd PATH_TO_PYCAM"
6) "python PYINSTALLER_PATH/utils/Configure.py"
7) "python PYINSTALLER_PATH/utils/Build.py pyinstaller/pycam.spec"
8) test and upload the binary file "pycam-VERSION_standalone.?"

Known issues:
* multiprocessing on Windows: no server/client capabilities
* python-setproctitle v1.0.1 causes a segfault - remove it from the build system
* Linux: pre-built executable don't seem to work across different versions of libc 
* Linux/MacOS?: you need to remove the reference to "windll" at the top of the "pycam" script (line 32-36)
